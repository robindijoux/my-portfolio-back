  # Delete project - üîê REQUIRES AUTHENTICATION
  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED**: This endpoint now requires a valid JWT token from AWS Cognito.
  
  Delete a project by its ID.
  
  ## Authentication Setup:
  1. Configure `jwt_token` variable in Bruno environment
  2. Get JWT token from AWS Cognito (see Authentication folder)
  3. Token is automatically added as Bearer token
  
  This will permanently remove the project and all associated media files.
  Use with caution as this operation cannot be undone.
  
  **For authentication**: See Authentication folder for token setup.
